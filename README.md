My personal blog website focused on classic and modern literature

This website was built as my introduction to web development.

The website is built without the use of any frameworks or libraries in order for me to gain a strong foundational knowledge of web development.

The site is 4 pages and was built with the following tools:
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
4. Vanilla JS
5. PHP7

The use of javascript is purely for animations of the navigation menu. All other animation and hover effects use CSS3. The backend development is limited to the 'Contact Us' form. The form is set to email to a specified destination (my personal email :P) using Post function in PHP7.
