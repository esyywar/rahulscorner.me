				<h1>What I Learned from The Bell Jar</h1>

		<div class="main-article">

			<p class="article-para"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>t was just a couple years ago when I started to recognize the abundance of mental illness awareness promotions
			that were all around me.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">I was regularly reading posts on my social media, seeing posters around my University, and noticing the large corporations that were 
			conducting these ad campaigns. I must confess that at the time, mental illness was never truly a cause I could get behind. This was mainly due to my refusal to 
			accept that common emotions such as depression and anxiety could be deemed a debilitating illness.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">I knew that mental hardships were an inevitable part of the human experience and I strongly believed that by advertising these afflictions 
			as a medical illness, we were weakening peoples' ability to combat them! I felt that people who needed strength and support in difficult times were instead being 
			given a chronic illness to blame. However, one day I picked up an extraordinary novel that drastically changed my perspective on mental illness.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">This story invited me deep into the mind of a young woman struggling with anxiety and depression while she navigated the ever-unsure phase 
			of her life which many of us face during our youth. From reading this story, I learned a valuable lesson in caring for myself and others during times of mental 
			challenge. Without spoiling any elements of this powerful story, I would like to share more about the book's values and how it has specifically impacted me.</p>

			<p class="article-para half">The book I refer to is titled, "The Bell Jar" by Sylvia Plath. Sylvia Plath was an American poet who wrote her most famous works in the 1960s. 
			She popularized a very unique form of confessional poetry which earned her a Pulitzer Prize. In 1963, Plath tragically took her own life at the age of 30 after a 
			life long battle with depression. Just a few months before her death, Plath published, "The Bell Jar," her only novel. The Bell Jar is an autobiographical 
			fiction that Plath herself described as a distorted story of her own experience. Hence, many of the events and characters in the story are drawn from Plath's 
			real life. In fact, Plath originally published the book under a pseudonym, presumably to mask the true characters and events. To date, the Bell Jar remains one of 
			the most insightful texts I have read.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="article-para">The story is written from the perspective of a 20 year old woman named Esther Greenwood, whose character is based on Sylvia Plath. At the 
			beginning of the novel, Esther finds herself on an internship in New York City as a guest editor for a successful magazine! Esther has earned this opportunity as 
			a result of her excellent achievements as a literature student at her University. Being among several other young woman who have been selected for this 
			trip, Esther is treated to parties, dinners, and the freedom to explore a new city. Although this sounds extravagant on the surface, it quickly becomes 
			clear to the reader that Esther is not having much fun - she is somehow trapped within herself.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">Upon reading on, we discover that Esther has a deeply rooted dissatisfaction with her accomplishments, her 
			family, her friends and her life as a whole. More importantly, her feelings of dissatisfaction feel largely disconnected from reality and it is difficult to imagine 
			what sort of external conditions could bring any positive change to Esther's psyche. Over the course of the story, the reader watches as Esther returns home to live 
			with her mother and begins slipping deeper into a depressive episode. Plath likens Esther's plight to being suffocated underneath a large metaphorical bell jar.</p>

			<p class="article-para">Many of the challenges Esther faces in her life stem from her role as a young woman in 1950s America. Esther does not agree with the 
			expectations imposed on her by men, her family or society at large. She has recognized that her beliefs are unpopular and this effectively discourages Esther from 
			sharing much of her thoughts with anyone. Through Esther's experience as a woman, Plath goes on to explore themes of feminism, sexuality and gender roles.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para"> Similarly, Esther finds difficulty in dealing with the uncertainty of her future. Esther is shown to be an intelligent and talented 
			individual but she suffers from a paralyzing fear of making a wrong decision. As a consequence, she is haunted by the feeling of watching her potential slip away.
			In one of the most memorable passages of the book, Esther expresses her dilemma by describing a metaphorical fig tree: </p>

			<p class="emp-quote three-quarter">"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful 
			future beckoned and winked... I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would 
			choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go 
			black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."</p>

			</div>

			<p class="article-para">This sort of vivid and bravely honest writing is what Plath was known for and it is on full display in her novel. Passages such as this are 
			scattered throughout the book and make it an especially relatable read to those in young stages of life.</p>

			<p class="article-para">As the reader becomes more intimately acquainted with Esther, the struggles associated with mental illness become increasingly clear. 
			Indecisiveness, loneliness and disinterest are the demons that follow Esther wherever she goes. When Esther is left alone in her thoughts is when her illness 
			becomes most severe. Esther's work, academics, friends, family and her pursuit of a career as a writer provide her with some form of a healthy escape from her woes.
			They say the idol mind is a devil's workshop and it is true in this novel.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">As Esther falls deeper within the clenches of her empty mind, her motivation dwindles and she seems to become helpless. For the reader, 
			it is sometimes a frightening process to observe. At the same time, there is plenty for the reader to learn from the dark times in Esther's battle.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">The greatest factor I find contributing to Esther's downward spiral is that she has nobody she can speak to about her difficulties. 
			Esther's friends and family can all discern that Esther is not quite herself but they all have their own opinions of why it is so. A few of these characters
			have the willingness to help Esther, but they lack knowledge of mental illness and do not show the open-mindedness required to listen to Esther without imposing 
			their own beliefs.</p>

			<p class="article-para">At points in the novel, Esther does show admirable signs of relief and improvement. Without giving away any of the later events in the 
			story, I will simply say that the changes which occur in Esther's life during the time of her improvement give clues about the most simple courtesies that can 
			make a difference in our lives.</p>

			<p class="article-para">When I finished this novel, I was left with plenty of food for thought and found myself re-reading chapters over the next weeks. 
			I took a closer look at many of Plath's poems and listened to dozens of interviews featuring her. I did all this to search for the message of an ultimate cure 
			which must be somewhere in these pages!</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">After taking time to digest it all, I came to the understanding that there was no ultimate cure, but rather a practical lesson to be learned. 
			Anybody who reads The Bell Jar will be able to relate to Esther on some level. This is because we are all complex people who are fighting out own mental battles. 
			I learned to take comfort in the fact that my insecurities and unique challenges are what make me human and that overcoming them is merely the process of growth.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="article-para">For all the value it has brought me, I hope others can also read and enjoy this book. Plath's novel gives such a pure perspective of 
			Esther's experience that the conclusions we can draw from the story are as subjective as those that each of us can draw from our own individual experiences - 
			this is a testament to the truthfulness of Plath's writing. Readers might take some time to acclimate to the apathetic tone Plath writes the story with but the 
			effort is worth it. The characters will all soon feel as acquainted as a close friend and the impression left on the reader is lasting.</p>

			<p class="article-para">In my case, Plath's cautionary tale has taught me to make the effort to become more comfortable in talking about my mental hardships. 
			This has been a challenge for me as my pride and ego make me reluctant to confess any insecurities to myself much less anyone else! However, I am discovering the 
			rewarding relief of acknowledging my shortcomings and facing them directly. I believe developing such a discipline could have saved Esther Greenwood.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">I realized that the benefit of promoting mental health awareness is in making clear to all that we are not alone and that the greatest service 
			we can do for our mental health is cultivating the strength to talk about it.</p>
			
			<p class="article-para">In the end, it is a truer mark of strength to be confident and courageous in our vulnerability than to be stubborn in our suffering.</p>
