						<p>My personal favourite work of the nobel prize winning novelist William Faulkner. The story is set in Faulkner's fictional 
						Mississipi town during the 1920s. The tragic racial past of America is laid bare for the reader to see. Joe Christmas is one intruiging character
						who is living his life as a white man though constantly haunted by the possibility of his african blood. The writing quality is superlative 
						with stunning descriptive passages and well defined characters.</p>

						<p>William Faulkner uses a mosiac of stories to explore themes including discrimination, family and death. This is the story of the Compson family 
						who endure a series of tragic events. This book is tremendously challenging and is not at all a casual read! 
						Faulkner often writes while ignoring chronology, setting and even grammar in order to convey the mental state of characters. The book leaves you with 
						plenty of food for thought with a bit of a heavy heart.</p>

						<p>Orwell's famous dystopian world in which the totalitarian governement controls the population through use of propaganda, censorship and 
						surveillance. Our protaganist is Winston Smith who works for the governement and posseses a desperate longing for truth. 
						The amazing quality of this book lies in the details. For every dreadful deed perpetrated by the government, Orwell offers a genuine and often rationale

						<p>Adiga tells a story about the class struggle in 21st century India through the perspective of Balram who was raised in the improverished 
						"darkness" but carves his own way to freedom. Written with a tone of cutting cynacism and humour, we explore issues of caste, religion, money, 
						family and corruption. Deeply rooted societal issues, authentic characters and the exciting eat-or-be-eaten mentality defining modern India 
						keep the reader engaged.</p>

						<p>The scene is set in a small Mennonite town called East Village which is loosely based on the author's hometown of Steinbach, Manitoba. Our 
						narrator is Nomi, who is feeling greatly constricted by the religious and cultural practices forced on her in East Village. Nomi's 
						elder sister and mother have both fled the town but she remains out of a binding loyalty to her father. This is a bittersweet coming-of-age 
						story with a peek into a life most are unfamiliar with.</p>

						<p>A simple and inspring story with an impactful message! Toku'te grows up in a generational farming family but has the passion to pursue 
						entrepreneurship - Dreams vs. Tradition. There is an equally great story behind the authorship: Baruwa wrote the book in secret while 
						completing his undergrad, self-funded the publication of the novel and even sold copies door to door. An enjoyable read and extremely relatable 
						for anyone coming from a traditional background.</p>

						the narrator, Esther Greenwood. Many of the events and characters in the story are taken from Plath's own life. Esther is fraught by a depression
